## Running Tests

*cargo test --all-features*

## Building The Documentation

*cargo doc --all-features*

## Todo

- Add more documentation
- Add code examples
- Clean-up the code

## Coding Style

This project uses a coding style that emphasises the use of white space over keeping the line and column counts as low as possible.

So this:

```rust

fn bar() {} 

fn foo()
{

    bar();

}

```

Not this:

```rust

fn bar() {} 

fn foo()
{
    bar();
}

```
